# Tarentaine_GHGs
R script and data files associated with analysis and visualization of data from the manuscript "Small water impoundments have longitudinal and local impacts on carbon cycling along a river network"

This repository includes: 
- an R scirpt used to analyze and visualize the data (Data_analysis_Tarentaine.R)
- an R script used to calculate the CO2 and CH4 fluxes (GHG_Tarentaine.R)
- an R scirpt used to calculate the leaf litter decopmosition rate (Leaf_litter_decomp.R)
- an R script used to calculate the organic matter stocks and fluxes (OM_stock_flux.R)
- an R script used to calculate the air and water temperature from continuous ibutton datalogger measurements (iButton_air_temp.R)
- a .csv file file with the CO2 and CH4 fluxes (CO2.CH4.fluxes.csv)
- a .csv file with all of the data (dat.csv)
- a .csv file with the site mean data (dat_means.csv)
